	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

	abstract = {To establish that a document was created after a given moment in time, it is necessary to report events that could not have been predicted before they happened. To establish that a document was created before a given moment in time, it is necessary to cause an event based on the document, which can be observed by others. Cryptographic hash functions can be used both to report events succinctly, and to cause events based on documents without revealing their contents. Haber and Stornetta have proposed two schemes for digital time-stamping which rely on these principles [{HaSt} 91].We reexamine one of those protocols, addressing the resource constraint required for storage and verification of time-stamp certificates. By using trees, we show how to achieve an exponential increase in the publicity obtained for each time-stamping event, while reducing the storage and the computation required in order to validate a given certificate.We show how time-stamping can be used in certain circumstances to extend the useful lifetime of different kinds of cryptographic certifications of authenticity, in the event that the certifying protocol is compromised. This can be applied to digital signatures, or to time-stamping itself, making the digital time-stamping process renewable.},

The problem is to time-stamp the data, not the medium. We propose computationally practical procedures for digital time-stamping of such documents so that it is infeasible for a user either to back-date or to forward-date his document, even with the collusion of a time-stamping service. Our procedures maintain complete privacy of the documents themselves, and require no record-keeping by the time-stamping service.},

A decentralized system is proposed whereby transactions are sent over a network of micropayment channels (a.k.a. payment channels or transaction channels) whose transfer of value occurs oﬀ-blockchain. If Bitcoin transactions can be signed with a new sighash type that addresses malleability, these transfers may occur between untrusted parties along the transfer route by contracts which, in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, are enforceable via broadcast over the bitcoin blockchain in the event of uncooperative or hostile participants, through a series of decrementing timelocks.},
