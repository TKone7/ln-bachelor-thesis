	abstract = {A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of {CPU} power. As long as a majority of {CPU} power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

To establish that a document was created before a given moment in time, it is necessary to cause an event based on the document, which can be observed by others. Cryptographic hash functions can be used both to report events succinctly, and to cause events based on documents without revealing their contents. Haber and Stornetta have proposed two schemes for digital time-stamping which rely on these principles [{HaSt} 91].We reexamine one of those protocols, addressing the resource constraint required for storage and verification of time-stamp certificates. By using trees, we show how to achieve an exponential increase in the publicity obtained for each time-stamping event, while reducing the storage and the computation required in order to validate a given certificate.We show how time-stamping can be used in certain circumstances to extend the useful lifetime of different kinds of cryptographic certifications of authenticity, in the event that the certifying protocol is compromised. This can be applied to digital signatures, or to time-stamping itself, making the digital time-stamping process renewable.},

The social network analysis techniques, included, will help readers to efficiently analyze social data from Twitter, Facebook, {LiveJournal}, {GitHub} and many others at three levels of depth: ego, group, and community. They will be able to analyse militant and revolutionary networks and candidate networks during elections. For instance, they will learn how the Ebola virus spread through communities. Practically, the book is suitable for courses on social network analysis in all disciplines that use social methodology. In the study of social networks, social network analysis makes an interesting interdisciplinary research area, where computer scientists and sociologists bring their competence to a level that will enable them to meet the challenges of this fast-developing field. Computer scientists have the knowledge to parse and process data while sociologists have the experience that is required for efficient data editing and interpretation. Social network analysis has successfully been applied in different fields such as health, cyber security, business, animal social networks, information retrieval, and communications.},

@article{tikhomirov_probing_2020,

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.00333},
	abstract = {As Lightning network payments are neither broadcasted nor publicly stored. Thus {LN} has been seen not only as scalability but also as privacy solution for Bitcoin. The protocol guarantees that only the latest channel state can be confirmed on channel closure. {LN} nodes gossip about channels available for routing and their total capacities. To issue a (multi-hop) payment, the sender creates a route based on its local knowledge of the graph. As local channel balances are not public, payments often fail due to insufficient balance at an intermediary hop. In that case, the payment is attempted along multiple routes until it succeeds. This constitutes a privacy-efficiency tradeoff: hidden balances improve privacy but hinder routing efficiency. In this work, we show that an attacker can easily discover channel balances using probing. This takes under a minute per channel and requires moderate capital commitment and no expenditures. We describe the algorithm and test our proof-of-concept implementation on Bitcoin's testnet. We argue that {LN}'s balance between privacy and routing efficiency is suboptimal: channel balances are neither well protected nor utilized. We outline two ways for {LN} to evolve in respect to this issue. To emphasize privacy, we propose a modification of error handling that hides details of the erring channel from the sending node. This would break our probing technique but make routing failures more common, as the sender would not know which channel from the attempted route has failed. To improve efficiency, we propose a new {API} call that would let the sender query balances of channels that it is not a party of. We argue that combining these approaches can help {LN} take the best of both worlds: hide private data when feasible, and utilize public data for higher routing efficiency.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientiﬁc interest and have signiﬁcant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large ﬂuctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the diﬃculty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares ﬁtting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood ﬁtting methods with goodness-of-ﬁt tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the eﬀectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of diﬀerent disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a powerlaw distribution. In some cases we ﬁnd these conjectures to be consistent with the data while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {Analyzing the Social Web provides a framework for the analysis of public data currently available and being generated by social networks and social media, like Facebook, Twitter, and Foursquare. Access and analysis of this public data about people and their connections to one another allows for new applications of traditional social network analysis techniques that let us identify things like who are the most important or influential people in a network, how things will spread through the network, and the nature of peoples' relationships. Analyzing the Social Web introduces you to these techniques, shows you their application to many different types of social media, and discusses how social media can be used as a tool for interacting with the online public. Presents interactive social applications on the web, and the types of analysis that are currently conducted in the study of social media. Covers the basics of network structures for beginners, including measuring methods for describing nodes, edges, and parts of the network. Discusses the major categories of social media applications or phenomena and shows how the techniques presented can be applied to analyze and understand the underlying data. Provides an introduction to information visualization, particularly network visualization techniques, and methods for using them to identify interesting features in a network, generate hypotheses for analysis, and recognize patterns of behavior. Includes a supporting website with lecture slides, exercises, and downloadable social network data sets that can be used can be used to apply the techniques presented in the book.},
